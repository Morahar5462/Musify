# 🎶 Musify - AI-Powered Music Composition

Musify is an innovative deep learning framework that transforms musical data into structured MIDI outputs. Designed to assist composers, producers, and enthusiasts, Musify uses LSTM-based neural networks to generate human-like melodies and seamlessly integrates with Digital Audio Workstations (DAWs) like FL Studio, Ableton Live, and Logic Pro.

## 🚀 Features

- 🎼 **AI-Based Melody Generation**: Uses Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to learn and generate musical sequences.
- 📊 **Music Feature Extraction**: Processes kern-formatted musical scores to extract pitch, duration, and velocity as time-series data.
- 🎧 **MIDI Output**: Converts generated melodies into MIDI files for easy integration with popular DAWs.
- 🧠 **Real-Time Analysis Tools**:
  - Harmonic transition analysis
  - Pattern recognition
  - Stylistic influence indicators
- 💻 **User-Friendly Interface**: Designed to enhance creative collaboration between human input and AI output.
